# System Prompt Update Summary

## Date: 2025年10月29日

## Overview
Updated the spatial AI agent's system prompt to reference a comprehensive, centralized documentation file for better maintainability and AI understanding.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created New Documentation
**File**: `docs/COMPREHENSIVE_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`

A complete, systematic system prompt document that covers:
- Core identity & mission
- System architecture (5 layers)
- Complete data model & conventions
- All 5 tools with detailed specifications (VOL, CLR, BBD, RCN, VIS)
- Tool invocation protocols (explicit & NLP-triggered)
- Two-stage query processing (scope classification → response generation)
- Comprehensive response guidelines
- **Enhanced RGB color interpretation guide** (critical for CLR tool)
- Advanced capabilities (spatial reasoning, semantic understanding, comparative analysis)
- Limitations & error handling
- Complete output format examples

### 2. Updated Agent Implementation
**File**: `mutli_room_agent2.py`

#### Class Docstring Enhancement
Added a prominent reference section:
```python
📖 COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM PROMPT DOCUMENTATION:
For detailed information about the complete system capabilities, tool specifications,
and response guidelines, see: docs/COMPREHENSIVE_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md
```

#### Enhanced System Prompt
The `_create_system_prompt()` method now includes:

1. **Method Documentation**:
   - Added comprehensive docstring referencing the full documentation
   - Lists all major topics covered in the documentation

2. **Improved Base Prompt**:
   - Added "SYSTEM CAPABILITIES" section describing the full tech stack
   - Enhanced tool descriptions, especially for CLR (color analysis)
   - **Embedded RGB interpretation guide** directly in the prompt for immediate reference
   - Added concrete color interpretation examples

3. **Enhanced Response Guidelines**:
   - Expanded from 6 to 8 numbered guidelines
   - Added specific examples for color interpretation
   - Included reference to full documentation for detailed guidance
   - Added "Spatial Context" guideline
   - Restructured for better clarity with bold headings

4. **Documentation References**:
   - Multiple references throughout pointing to the comprehensive documentation
   - Clear signposting of where to find detailed information

## Key Improvements

### 1. Better Color Interpretation
The most critical improvement addresses the RGB-to-color-name translation:

**Before**:
> "You will receive raw RGB values, and you must interpret them into common color names"

**After**:
> ⚠️ CRITICAL: You will receive raw RGB values [0-255]. You MUST interpret them into human-readable color names.
> - RGB interpretation guide:
>   • [0-50]: Very dark/black tones
>   • [50-100]: Dark tones  
>   • [100-150]: Medium-dark
>   • [150-200]: Medium-light
>   • [200-255]: Light/bright
> - Hue identification: High R→red, High G→green, High B→blue, High R+G→yellow/orange, etc.
> - Example: [180, 195, 185] → "soft sage green", [45, 78, 120] → "dark steel blue"

### 2. Maintainability
- Centralized documentation eliminates need to edit prompts in multiple places
- Easier to update and version control
- Clear separation between implementation and prompt engineering

### 3. AI Comprehension
- More structured and systematic organization
- Clear hierarchy of information
- Abundant examples and concrete specifications
- Explicit references guide the AI to detailed information when needed

### 4. Completeness
The new documentation covers topics that were previously implicit or missing:
- Complete RGB color interpretation tables
- Spatial reasoning patterns
- Multi-modal analysis workflow
- Error handling protocols
- Advanced capabilities documentation

## Usage

### For Developers
When updating system capabilities or behavior:
1. Update `docs/COMPREHENSIVE_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` with the new specification
2. The in-code prompt in `mutli_room_agent2.py` only needs updates if:
   - Core tool list changes
   - Critical runtime information needs embedding
   - Dynamic data formatting changes

### For AI Training
The comprehensive documentation serves as:
- Primary reference for system capabilities
- Complete specification for expected behavior
- Training material for proper tool usage
- Guide for response formatting

### For Users
The documentation provides:
- Complete understanding of what the AI can and cannot do
- Examples of proper query formats
- Expected response patterns
- System limitations

## Benefits

1. **Single Source of Truth**: All system specifications in one place
2. **Better AI Performance**: More detailed guidance leads to better responses
3. **Easier Maintenance**: Update once, apply everywhere
4. **Version Control**: Track changes to system behavior over time
5. **Onboarding**: New developers/users have complete reference
6. **Debugging**: Clear specification helps identify discrepancies

## Testing Recommendations

Test the updated prompt with queries that previously had issues:
1. ✅ Color interpretation queries (CLR tool)
2. ✅ Multi-room comparisons
3. ✅ NLP-triggered tool calls
4. ✅ Visualization requests with room names
5. ✅ Spatial relationship queries

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding to the comprehensive documentation:
- Tool performance benchmarks
- Common query patterns and optimal responses
- Troubleshooting guide
- FAQ section
- Version history

---

**Summary**: This update creates a robust, maintainable foundation for the spatial AI system with comprehensive documentation that improves AI understanding and response quality, particularly for color interpretation tasks.
